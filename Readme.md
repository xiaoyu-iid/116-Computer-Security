# 116-Computer-Security
## This is the repository for some of my works in Comp116: Introduction to Computer Security.

## This repository is consisted of:
	1. Forensics. We were given a disc image for file recovery. The disc image turned out to be an Android mobile device.

	2. Scapy. We were supposed to develop an "alarm" to alert NULL/FIN/Xmas scans, Nmap scans, Nikto scans, Masscan, Shellshock, unauthorized access of phpAdmin and leaked passwords and credit card information in a pcap file. The other part of it was to reconstruct images from dismantled data packages in a pcap.
	
	3. Technical Risk Analysis, where were supposed to analyze the vulnerabilities of an online application, and cross-reference our findings with those given by a security scanner.
